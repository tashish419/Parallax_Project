            Thankyou for showing interest,
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. I have started my 
            programming journey just a couple
            of months ago after two successive
            attempts of UPSC CSE.
            I am currently learning required 
            skills to get hired as frontend developer.
            So far i am done with HTML, CSS and learned basics 
            of JavaScript and this webpage is one 
            of my Web Development projects 
            using HTML and CSS only.I like
            coding all kind of problems
            from the very basic like adding
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I am really enjoying this journey 
            and looking forward to contribute more 
            in the programming world.
